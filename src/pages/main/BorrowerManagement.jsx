                Other vendors force you to chase after participants to acquire countless documents and signatures. That increases your cognitive load and wastes your valuable time, delaying closing
                and disbursement. <br />
                <br />
                In contrast, CMC always acts as an intermediary with the borrower. We don't just recommend that documents be provided -- we track down documents and enforce their submission. Your
                hassle becomes our hassle.
