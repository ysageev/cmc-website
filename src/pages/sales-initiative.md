# Sales initiative

## Goal

Every four (4) months, on average:

-   Achieve enough new book of business to hire another consultant.
-   Open up 1 new service area, or expand two underperforming existing ones, such as PA and NC

---

<br />

## Step 1: Preparation: (3 weeks)

### Organize a central location for the team to store all marketing materials

-   This will be the single "source of truth"
-   All existing locations must be merged into this one location
-   No other locations are permissible

### Finalize mantras (Mark, Yair, Derek, Anthony)

-   Clarify and finalize language of main business mantras. These should be short, sweet and memorable:
-   CMC is everywhere.
-   No project too big or too small. All scopes and sizes
-   ?? Borrower Education and Borrower Management. Discuss what this means. Is this really a pillar?

### Email signatures

-   Ensure everyone's signature communicates mantras, or at least service area.
-   Signatures can be re-thought. We don't need to have our snail mail address, for example.

### Finalize marketing materials and language

-   Website
-   Front page
    -   Service area section
        -   Expand, Finalize language
    -   Project "all scopes and sizes" section with graphics and verbiage.
-   Detailed "white paper" pages
    -   Service Area
    -   Scopes
-   Ensure consistency of graphics and messaging between website, LinkedIn, Statement of qualifications, etc

### Signoff on all marketing materials

## Step 2: First Quarterly Email Blast (QEB) (2 Weeks)

### Create "News" website section

-   Each blog post in "News" section of website that contains all content for a QEB.
-   For every QEB, we first create a blog post in the "News" section
-   Content should include:
    -   Service area reinforcement
    -   All scopes and sizes reinforcement
    -   "Spotlight" on say, 6 active projects that juxtapose state, size, type
    -   Useful analysis of current events related to CRE. E.g., stuff Chris Maxwell asks for.
    -   Links to interesting articles related to CRE
    -   Ensure that we like the content and layout, and that everyone approves.

### Send QEB

-   Should contain all content from 3A.
-   Determine layout of email, reusable template
-   Determine recipients
-   Send

<br />

### Scripts and Kits for meetings

-   Remote meetings
    -   Create materials kit of online resources
    -   Create script which includes
        -   Meeting agenda
        -   Key talking points
-   In-person meetings - Create script which includes - Meeting agenda - Key talking points - Sales conduct recommendations

## Step 3: Yair hits the road

### Existing Customers

-   Meet with and take out to lunch, key personnel of existing customers.
-   Meeting goals
    -   Determine if the customer has projects outside of traditional CMC assigned service-area.
    -   If bank service areas are managed by separate silos, goal of meeting is to get contact info and introductions to these people.
    -   Ensure that they understand our desire for new service areas, and willingness to handle smaller projects.

### New Customers

-   Research and create list of leads
-   Attempt to nail down remote meeting
-   Suggest in-person meeting
