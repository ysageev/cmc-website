                <div className="block-header">Non-Personal Information</div>
                <div className="block-content">
                    Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity. CMC may collect and analyze non-personal
                    information to evaluate how visitors use CMC's web site.

                <div className="block-header">Aggregate Information</div>
                <div className="block-content">
                    CMC may gather aggregate information, which refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples
                    include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP
                    address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log
                    your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.
                </div>
                <div className="block-header">Log Files</div>

                <div className="block-content">
                    Every time you request or download a file from the web site, CMC may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. CMC may use this information to analyze
                    trends, administer the web site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes.

                    Our site may use a feature of your browser to set a “cookie” on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a web site's computer stores on your computer. CMC's
                    web site can then read the cookies whenever you visit our site. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you
                    visit our site, to deliver content specific to your interests and to track the pages you've visited. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to customize your

                <div className="block-content">
                    CMC's web site also may use web beacons to collect non-personal information about your use of our web site and the web sites of selected sponsors or members, your use of special
                    promotions or newsletters, and other activities. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our web site and selected
                    sponsors' sites; how many people open our emails; and for what purposes these actions are being taken. Our web beacons are not used to track your activity outside of our web site

                    and organizations. Member contact information may be provided to other members on a secure web site to encourage and facilitate collaboration, research, and the free exchange of
                    information among CMC's members, but we expressly prohibit members from using member contact information to send unsolicited commercial correspondence. CMC's members automatically
                    are added to CMC's member mailing lists. From time to time, member information may be shared with event organizers and/or other organizations that provide additional benefits to
                    CMC's members. By providing us with your personal information on the membership application, you expressly consent to our storing, processing, and distributing your information for

                    Company information is information that is associated with the name and address of member organizations and may include data about usage and service operation. The primary
                    representative of any CMC's member organizations may request usage reports to gauge the extent of their employees' involvement in consortium activities. You should be aware that
                    information regarding your participation in technical committees or working groups, for example, may be made available to your company's primary representative and to CMC's staff
                    members.

                    CMC may use personal information to provide services that support the activities of CMC's members and their collaboration on CMC's standards and projects. When accessing CMC's
                    members-only web pages, your personal user information may be tracked by CMC in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication between members.

                    CMC does not sell, rent, or lease any individual's personal information or lists of email addresses to anyone for marketing purposes, and we take commercially reasonable steps to
                    maintain the security of this information. However, CMC reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which CMC may merge in the future or to which it
                    may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of its mission. We also reserve the right to release personal information to protect our systems or
                    business, when we reasonably believe you to be in violation of our Terms of Use or if we reasonably believe you to have initiated or participated in any illegal activity. In
                    addition, please be aware that in certain circumstances, CMC may be obligated to release your personal information pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or
                    other orders.

                    In keeping with our open process, CMC may maintain publicly accessible archives for the vast majority of our activities. For example, posting an email to any of CMC's-hosted mail
                    list or discussion forum, subscribing to one of our newsletters or registering for one of our public meetings may result in your email address becoming part of the publicly

                    On some sites, anonymous users are allowed to post content and/or participate in forum discussions. In such a case, since no user name can be associated with such a user, the IP

                    That data may be generally visible to other of CMC's members and to the public. Your name, e-mail address, and other information you may supply also may be associated in CMC's

                    of 24 October 1995 (“EU Privacy Directive”) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, individuals
