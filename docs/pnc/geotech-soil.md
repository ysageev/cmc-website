# Geotechnical Soil Report


CMC recommends the report to include Site and Foundation construction recommendations.  Test Pit Observations and Soil Proctors alone do not constitute a geotechnical evaluation. The NYS Uniform Building Code requires a Geotechnical Report to be furnished to the Municipality as a condition of permit issuance.  Practices vary depending upon municipality requirements and project type.  If a Geotechnical Report is *not* required by the Municipality, the Design Professional of Record must furnish a letter to CMC affirming that a Geotechnical Report is not required.
