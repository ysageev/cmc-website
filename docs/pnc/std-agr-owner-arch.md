# Standard Agreement Between Owner and Contractor


The contracts submitted must be fully executed and include all exhibits and addenda. If multiple prime contractors are retained (for example, in order to complete sitework independent of building construction), the Owner must furnish separate contracts.

In some cases, Lenders require that the Owner provide copies of subcontracts.
