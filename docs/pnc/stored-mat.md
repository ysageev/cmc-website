# Stored Materials


Funding of on- and off- site stored materials is loan-specific.  The following criteria are generally accepted.

Off-site stored material requirements:

- Pictures of off-site stored materials clearly labeled with the project name and owner
- Off-site stored material affidavit (notarized)
- Invoices for off-site stored materials
- Insurance certificate with the lender named an additional insured (notarized)
- Transfer of title to owner (notarized)
- Evidence that materials are stored in a bonded warehouse

On-site stored material recommendations:

- Materials are properly inventoried and clearly stenciled or otherwise marked to indicate that they are the property of the borrower
- Bills of sale are provided
- Materials are stored in a secure location, protected against damage and are insured against casualty, loss and theft
