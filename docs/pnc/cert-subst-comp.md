# Certificate of Substantial Completion


A certificate of substantial completion signed by the architect, owner and contractor must be submitted prior to the release of retainage and prior to advancing final funding.  Should seasonal or deficient work require completion a mutually agreeable hold-back reserve shall be established and attached to the certificate of substantial completetion.  In some cases lenders may apply a multiplier to the reserve total.
