# Application Certificate of Payment

An Application for Payment (G702 and G703) is a standardized document contractors use to request payment for completed work and materials, with G702 as the summary and G703 as the detailed breakdown. Both the contractor and the design professional must sign it to verify construction progress, ensuring proper loan tracking, disbursement, and oversight.

Example documents and further explanation can be found at the [AIA Website](https://learn.aiacontracts.com/articles/completing-g702-and-g703-forms/).
