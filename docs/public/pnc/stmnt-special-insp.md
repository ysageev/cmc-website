# Statement of Special Inspections

The NYS Uniform Building Code requires a Statement of Special Inspections to be furnished by the Design Professional of Record (DPR) to the Municipality as a condition of permit issuance. Practices vary depending upon municipality requirements and project type.

If a Statement of Special Inspections is not required by the Municipality, the DPR must furnish a letter to CMC affirming that a Statement of Special Inspections is not required. In the absence of a Statement of Special Inspections, CMC requires that the DPR list what tests are to be performed.
