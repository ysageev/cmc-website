# Contractor's Payment and Performance Bond


A Contractor's Payment and Performance Bond guarantees the contractor will complete the project and pay all subcontractors and suppliers, protecting the construction loan from risks like default, delays, or liens. If required by the lender, copies should be sent to the consultant for review. If the bonds are not executed before loan closing, draft copies must also be provided. 

Example documents and further explanation can be found on the [AIA Website](https://learn.aiacontracts.com/articles/6484313-so-what-are-payment-and-performance-bonds-anyway/).
