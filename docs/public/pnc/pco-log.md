# PCO Log


a Potential Change Order Log must be presented with each draw request.   The log must include all known changes which may have a dollar or time impact.  The contractor should make every reasonable attempt to estimate a dollar value for potential work with the understanding that it is merely an estimate and is subject to revision.  PCO logs must be dated.
