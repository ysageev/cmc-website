# Contractor's Qualification Statement (AIA 305)

A Contractor's Qualification Statement (AIA A305) is a standardized document used to assess a contractor's financial stability, experience, and ability to complete a project. It is required for construction loans to evaluate the contractor's qualifications and mitigate risks associated with project completion and loan repayment.  

Example documents and further explanation can be found on the [AIA Website](https://help.aiacontracts.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500009307282-Instructions-A305-2020-Contractor-s-Qualification-Statement#instructions-a305-2020-contractor-s-qualification-statement-0).
