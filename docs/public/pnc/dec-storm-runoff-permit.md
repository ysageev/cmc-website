# Storm Runoff Permit

A Storm Runoff Permit is required to manage and regulate stormwater discharge from construction sites, ensuring compliance with environmental standards and preventing pollution. This permit helps mitigate environmental risks tied to construction loans and ensures projects meet local and state regulations. If a municipality requires a Stormwater Runoff Permit or Stormwater Runoff Prevention Permit, these must be submitted to CMC.
