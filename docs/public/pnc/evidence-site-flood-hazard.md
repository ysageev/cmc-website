# Evidence that Site is not in Flood Hazard Zone

A Flood Zone/Elevation Certificate is a document that verifies whether a property is located within a 100-year flood zone and provides elevation details to assess flood risk. This certificate is to ensure the property is not at high risk of flooding, which could impact the project's viability and collateral value.

Example documents and further explanation can be found on the [FEMA Website](https://agents.floodsmart.gov/write-policy/elevation-certificates).
