# Geotechnical Soil Report

CMC recommends the report to include Site and Foundation construction recommendations. Test Pit Observations and Soil Proctors alone do not constitute a geotechnical evaluation. The NYS Uniform Building Code requires a Geotechnical Report to be furnished to the Municipality as a condition of permit issuance. Practices vary depending upon municipality requirements and project type. If a Geotechnical Report is _not_ required by the Municipality, the Design Professional of Record must furnish a letter to CMC affirming that a Geotechnical Report is not required.
