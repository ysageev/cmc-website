# Standard Agreement Between Owner and Contractor

The Standard Agreement Between Owner and Contractors is a formal contract outlining the responsibilities, scope of work, and terms of the construction project. Fully executed contracts (including exhibits and addenda) should be provided to ensure the project is clearly defined, adequately managed, and financially safeguarded, particularly when multiple contractors or subcontracts are involved.

The contracts submitted must be fully executed and include all exhibits and addenda. If multiple prime contractors are retained (for example, in order to complete sitework independent of building construction), the Owner must furnish separate contracts.

In some cases, Lenders require that the Owner provide copies of subcontracts.
