# ALTA Site Survey

An ALTA survey is a detailed land survey that maps property boundaries, improvements, and easements per ALTA/NSPS standards. Required for commercial real estate transactions, it ensures clear ownership, identifies encumbrances, and meets lender and title insurance requirements. The survey must be certified by the lender.

Example documents and further explanation can be found at the [NSPS website](https://nsps.us.com/page/2021ALTA)
